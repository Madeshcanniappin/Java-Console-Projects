Just tried out a simple and fun console game called Cookie Clicker.
In this game, you click to earn cookies, and once you have enough, you can buy Auto Clickers that generate cookies for you every second.
Every time you click, you get 1 cookie
You can use cookies to buy Auto Clickers
Auto Clickers keep increasing your cookie count automatically
The price of Auto Clickers goes up each time you buy one
It was a cool way for me to explore Java basics like loops, conditions, input handling, and even added a bit of multithreading using Thread.sleep() for the auto-generation part.
